					BLUE21 QUIT SMOKING APP IN FREEBASIC V.1.0

			HELLO DEAR USER. QUITTING SMOKING IS A CHALLENGE AS SMOKING IS ADDICTIVE
			I CODED THIS APP WHILE STRUGGLING WITH QUITTING SMOKING MYSELF AFTER 
			SMOKING HEAVILY FOR 23 YEARS - I WAS A CHAIN SMOKER WHO SMOKED
			4 - 6 PACKS DAILY. THE SAD TRUTH IS THAT SMOKING KILLS THEREFORE
			IF I WANT TO LIVE I NEED TO QUIT FOR GOOD. AND YET IT IS ONE OF THE MOST 
			CHALLENGING DIFFICULT THING FOR ME.

			WHILE SOME PEOPLE SUCCEED TO QUIT MORE EASILY THEN OTHERS IT USUALLY TAKES
			7 PLUS FAILED ATTEMPTS TO QUIT TO SUCCEED IN QUITTING SMOKING FOR GOOD.

			LIKE ALL ADDICTIONS WHILE QUITTING AN ADDICTIVE SUBSTANCE AS NICOTINE
			THERE ARE CRAVINGS AND URGES TO SMOKE AGAIN - THESE CRAVINGS AND URGES
			BECOME LESS FREQUENTLY AS THE TIME PASS HOWEVER THERE WILL BE ALWAYS
			CRAVINGS FROM TIME TO TIME AND THEY PASS AWAY TILL NEXT TIME.

			THIS APP IS INTENDED TO BE USEFUL AS MUCH AS POSSIBLE HOWEVER IT IS UP TO YOU
			HOW TO USE IT AND HOW TO QUIT FOR GOOD SMOKING...

			I WISH ALL OF US ALL THE BEST AND HOPE BOTH OF US WILL ONE DAY BE ABLE TO BE
			EX-SMOKERS.
